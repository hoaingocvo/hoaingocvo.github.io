            This assignment is surprising because it is an activity that I am very familiar with. I have a habit of just walking around and enjoying the weather most of the time for no purpose. Especially when it rains, I love to carry my umbrella and just walk around to enjoy the smell of rain. This is because I have a Buddhist Background therefore sometimes a good walk works as powerful as our meditation habits. I sometimes prefer walking meditation ways more as I like to pay attention to little details around me and it is easier to do and distract myself because sometimes the boundary between thinking of nothing and thinking of everything at once is very blurry for beginners. Similar to what the reading and the videos talk about, with technology on the domination, people spend less time resting and paying attention to their surroundings, being more concentrated and enjoying.

        Today, the walk was very busy as it was the weekend. I actually preferred this walk to the one I usually took to get to the bus to go to VCU because the sidewalk was much smoother. The sidewalk was made of cement just like any other sidewalk, but it was very flat and smooth. There were some parts where it was a little bit uneven, and you might have tripped and fallen if you weren't paying attention, but that was minimal compared to the walk from my house to Grove Ave. The sidewalk was divided into two columns, but each square was massive and provided extra space for people moving in different directions. I guessed it was obvious how it should have been since Carytown was the famous shopping street downtown, and it was always busy, filled with people walking around.

As I was getting out of the Fresh Market parking lot, I saw someone parking their green and white scooter in the bike rack. That intrigued me because I wanted to get a bike as well, but VCU Pollak's parking had a no-scooter sign at the bike rack. The scooter had no lock in sight, was a Honda brand, and no one was standing near to keep an eye on it. I was skeptical about the risk of theft regarding scooter parking in these locations.

I encountered 4 to 5 shops before we got to Cary Street, which was filled with lots of shops. The majority were familiar big-brand stores and not many of those local small business ones, like CVS, ABC, tobacco vape shops, and McDonald's. The McDonald's was closed, which was a bit strange since they should have been open to attract more guests on the weekend.

        There was something interesting that I hadn’t noticed before. There was this funny-looking bicycle rack that I had mistaken for a bench at first since there were cool pattern decorations at both ends, which looked different from the other racks next to them. The pattern consisted of interwoven, repeated lines, but from a distance, it reminded me of the window carvings on traditional Vietnamese houses. Normally, when I just looked straight ahead while walking, I might have missed it.

        When I got to the intersection, a grey car was planning to turn right, so I had to rush through the lights since Carytown's main street was super busy, and I didn’t want to waste anyone’s time. There were many cars parked along the street. One thing that caught my attention was their license plates. I realized some people still hadn’t changed their stickers, and one of the stickers said it was set to expire in October 2024. I wondered if they were planning to change it during that week or risk getting pulled over by the police soon. As I walked by the first few stores, there was a Black woman standing outside her store, wearing a teal uniform top and jeans, with her hair tied up, enjoying a vape or cigarette during her break, I suppose.

        As I got past Burger Bach, there was an old couple having lunch on the porch. The woman had an eye-catching purple top that I thought paired well with her grey hair and gold accessories. Next to Burger Bach, there was a surfboard store with a funny-looking front display that featured a skeleton holding a surfboard and wearing sunglasses, a flowery necklace, shorts, and a cool hat—a combination of Halloween season and beach sport. Then we arrived at Penzeys Spices, and there was a sign on the glass window with a funny Trump quote: “Terrible Over-priced Products” with a smiley icon after it.
