    <h3>In what ways could Jane Jacobs be considered a designer?</h3>

    <div class="space">
        
        She observed opportunities that existed there. Hint for creativities, hint for regeneration. Even though she was not a trained designer in the sense of architect and urban planner, but she develop a conceptual contribution to the living spaces.
        Her designs focuses on human, for example, walk-able and lively neighborhoods, uses of spaces in the cities. For example, she advocating for concepts like: Eyes on the street, short blocks and high density, etc.

    <h3>What were three (3) methods/tactics used by Jane Jacobs in her work to save Washington Square Park?</h3>

    <div class="space">
        1. She built a community of people who were against Robert Moses’ idea of the people being cancerous
    </div>

    <div class="space">
        2. She brought the idea that more people means more vibrance, and that the city is a complex web of people working together and supporting each other
    </div>

    <div class="space">
        3. She explained how pushing poor people into projects only only divided the community and did not support the “mixed-use development’ plan she sought for (where people live, work, and shop in the same area)

    <h3>Identify and name similarities between the movie and the text. Identify and name differences between the two?</h3>

    <div class="space">       
        <b>Similarities</b>
    </div>

    <div class="space">       
        1. The Role of Individual Responsibility: Both Citizen Jane and Hand’s works underscore the power and responsibility of individuals in shaping democratic society. 
    </div>

    <div class="space">       
        2. Challenge to Authority and Expertise.
    </div>

    <div class="space">       
        3. Community Bonds and Empathy
    </div>

    <div class="space">       
        <b>Differences</b>
    </div>

    <div class="space">
        1. Scope of Focus: Hand addressing democracy on a broader scale, more abstract. While Jane's democracy is specific and narrow down to urban planing and daily lives of the people.
    </div>

    <div class="space">
        2. Context of Liberty: Hand's speech is set against the backdrop of World War II, where the concept of freedom is tied to larger existential and national concerns. Jacobs, however, is focused on the local impacts of urban planning, specifically how decisions in the urban landscape influence democratic engagement and community health.

    <h3>Based on watching the movie and reading the required text (or one of the alternative texts provided),</h3>
    <h3>what is the role of the individual in a democracy? (Specifically, cite the reading in the response)</h3>

    <div class="space">In both Citizen Jane and writings by Judge Learned Hand (1944) and Lincoln Caplan (2024), the role a individual plays in a society is portrayed as essential for protecting democratic values. 
        Judge Learned Hand’s “Spirit of Liberty” quote - “Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it.” The reading emphasizes that a functioning democracy relies on citizens upholding democratic values internally—not simply through external legal structures. Hand thinks the role of the individual in a democracy goes beyond voting or participating in civic processes; it requires actively cultivating values like tolerance, humility, and responsibility. In Lincoln Caplan's article "Learned Hand’s Spirit of Liberty," he highlights the essential role of the individual in a democracy as envisioned by Judge Learned Hand. Caplan emphasizes that Hand saw democracy as fundamentally rooted in the spirit and conscience of its citizens. In Citizen Jane: Battle for the City, the role of the individual in a democracy is vividly illustrated through Jane Jacobs's activism and opposition to large-scale urban planning projects that threatened her New York neighborhood. Her fight against Moses exemplifies a core democratic principle: that individuals have the right and responsibility to participate in decisions that affect their lives.
