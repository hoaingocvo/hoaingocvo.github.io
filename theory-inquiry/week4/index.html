        All of the elements like the horse, and the city, are icons to me. This is because the representation directly resembles the object. We can recognize it is a horse and a city without having to learn further or interpret other connecting keys.

        All of the objects presented are Icons for me. These are even more "icon" the the previous one due to the size and simplify art style that reminds me of social media emoji. We can recognize it is X-mas tree, a house and Santa Claus without having to learn further or interpret other connecting keys.

        <p>Citation: Hoai Ngoc Vo, “My Carrot Squishy”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="space">
        Classification type: Index, Icon
    </div>

    <div class="space">
        For me, an element that is "icon" is the carrot embroidery on the squish pillow's belly and rabbit ears; the eyes, nose, blushy cheek and tiny legs are "index". The carrot is an icon because it directly represents what it signifies. However, other elements are only connected to what a human and rabbit have but do not directly resemble what a human or rabbit looks like. (Ex. human eyes, and legs, are different from the squish; a rabbit should has 4 legs and be colored differently). I do have a little bit of hesitation since these "index" can also be interpreted as "icon" at the same time to a certain extent.
