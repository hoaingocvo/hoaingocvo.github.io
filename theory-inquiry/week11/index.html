        “Doing nothing” sounds easy until you actually practice it. During my exercise, I try to direct my attention to my breath and inner thoughts instead of the outside environment, just like they teach in meditation. I set up the environment with the least noise possible to minimize stimulation. I moved my phone and laptop to another room—“out of sight, out of mind.” Despite this, the first five minutes are hard. As I wander in my thoughts, I suddenly realize there are things I need to finish. For example, the dishes are piling up in the sink, along with the laundry. From five to ten minutes, it gets a bit easier. I decide to postpone other tasks and focus on doing nothing for a while. But then the phone rings and notifications chime in, which is frustrating because I forgot to turn them off earlier. I tell myself the call is a scam and decide to ignore it. Meanwhile, my cat goes crazy, meowing outside the door. Then I realize the cat hasn’t been fed, which is why he keeps meowing. I can only manage five more minutes before I go check the phone and put food in his bowl.

        One thing I agree with from the reading is that doing nothing might seem offensive in a work environment. As I sat there doing nothing, I recalled a conversation my manager had with another employee about needing a chair to rest. We work in a bakery, and there are times when there aren’t many customers, yet my manager loves to take a break. It’s odd that there aren’t many places to sit in the US work environment compared to Vietnam, where you can still pack bread or labor over cakes while sitting just as efficiently as standing. Employers often perceive sitting as lazy, even though workers are still doing their jobs. I remember a short-haired female employee who spent time doing “nothing” instead of checking her phone, and she was seen as intimidating.

        The author also discusses distraction, describing it as <b>a state in which the mind is disassembled, pointing in many different directions at once, thus preventing meaningful action.</b> I find it a bit ironic that the act of doing nothing can also be seen as a distraction according to this definition. While I’m doing nothing, my mind doesn’t fixate on one idea; it jumps around, and I’m not engaging in any “meaningful action” either. At the same time, my “doing nothing” is focused on simply being there, eyes closed, and thinking about life. It’s hard to concentrate on one thing while zoning out. It’s easier when you’re doing a task and want to focus solely on that—like when I’m counting how many cookies I’ve put in the box. This is interesting now that I reflect back on this.
